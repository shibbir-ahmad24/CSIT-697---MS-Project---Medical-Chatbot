# CSIT-697-MS-Project-Medical-Chatbot

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with LLMs for Clinical Question Answering**

# Overview

Healthcare professionals and researchers often need quick and reliable insights from medical records, especially discharge summaries, which contain critical patient information. This project aims to build an **AI-powered medical chatbot** that leverages **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Large Language Models (LLMs)** to answer clinical questions based on real-world patient discharge notes from the **MIMIC-IV dataset**.

By integrating **advanced NLP techniques**, this chatbot will provide meaningful, **context-aware responses** to help healthcare professionals, researchers, and even patients understand complex medical summaries efficiently.

# Problem Statement

Medical discharge summaries are **dense, complex, and filled with medical jargon,** making it challenging for both healthcare providers and patients to quickly extract relevant insights. Traditional chatbots, while useful, often struggle with **hallucinations (providing false information)** or fail to retrieve **accurate, case-specific knowledge** from structured datasets.

- **How can we ensure chatbot responses are grounded in real medical records?**
- **Does using a RAG-based approach improve response accuracy compared to a traditional LLM chatbot?**
- **How do we handle domain-specific medical terms and ensure responses align with real clinical knowledge?**

This project tackles these challenges by implementing a **retrieval-based knowledge system**, reducing misinformation and enhancing response reliability.
